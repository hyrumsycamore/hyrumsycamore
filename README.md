# Hyrum Sycamore 
# Computer Engineering Student at Brigham Young University 
# ------------------- Introduction ------------------- #
I’m a computer engineering student at Brigham Young University with a strong interest in robotics, UAVs, and spacecraft—systems where software and hardware come together to interact with the physical world. 
I’m currently finishing my junior year and am motivated by hands-on engineering work that takes ideas from concept through implementation.
I enjoy working across the full engineering stack—schematic design, PCB layout, firmware development, debugging with lab equipment, and system integration. 
I’m currently seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute to real-world engineering challenges, continue developing my embedded and systems-level skills, and work on projects that move—whether on the ground, in the air, or beyond it.

# ------------------- Current Coursework ------------------- #
 
  # ECEN 320: Fundamentals of Digital Systems
  Focus: Digital Logic Design & Hardware Description Languages (HDL).
  Key Skills: Designing complex combinational and sequential logic circuits; mastering SystemVerilog for RTL modeling; and implementing designs on FPGAs (Xilinx Artix-7) using modern synthesis tools like Vivado.
  # ECEN 390: Junior Team Design Project
  Focus: System-Level Integration & Collaborative Engineering. 
  Key Skills: Serving as the culminating "Junior Core" experience where I am integrating analog front-ends, digital signal processing (DSP), and embedded C firmware into a multiplayer Laser Tag system. This course emphasizes the full engineering lifecycle, from formal     requirements to hardware-in-the-loop testing.
  # ECEN 471: Machine Learning (Foundations & Apps)
  Focus: Statistical Learning & Engineering Applications.
  Key Skills: Implementing foundational ML algorithms (classification, regression, and clustering) specifically for engineering data; applying models to dynamical systems and time-series data—directly supporting my interest in autonomous drone and robotic navigation.

# ------------------- Future Project Ideas ------------------- #
  I love using engineering to solve problems for the people I care about. 
  Here is what's next on my workbench:

# The Ultimate Convertible Crib
  Family is a huge inspiration for me, and I’d love to build a crib that grows with my future kids.
  I’m planning to integrate a baby monitor, customizable night lights, and a white noise machine directly into the frame.

# Automated Nerf Turret
  I want to dive into TinyML to create a turret that aims and fires on its own.
  The goal is to use object tracking and human recognition to spot "targets."
  I even want to add a layer that recognizes if someone is carrying a "safe item" so it doesn't fire on friends!
